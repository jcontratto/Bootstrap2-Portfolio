                    <p>I graduated high school in 2001 at Lowville Academy and Central School and attended S.U.N.Y Brockport in Rochester, New York. I received my Bachelors 
                        Degree in Business Adminstration in 2006. While there I was the starting goalie on the varsity Lacrosse team and currently have 2 school records. Currently, I have the 
                        most saves in a season and most safes in a game. 
                        </p>

                    After graduating college, I entered the sales world and received my first job role as a sales representative at Cutco Inc. While this was fun, I wanted to do 
                    more and see more of the United States, so I decided to move to Raleigh, North Carolina on a whim. I have never regreted this decision and see how this city is expanding
                    and growing and becoming one my favorite cities in the United States. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                       Shortly after moving down from New York I was diagnosed with stage IV Germ Cell cancer and battled that for 3 years. I finally rid my cancer after completing
                       3 months (3 sessions) of Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplants and having been in remission now for 5 years! But, while I was undergoing chemo and all the other procedures,
                       I realized I needed to make important changes in my life, for example; diet, exercise and career. Now I want to better myself with computer technology and expand my
                       knowledge in the computer world.
